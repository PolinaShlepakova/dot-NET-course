###Using lambda functions to sort collection

Create class Student, which contains information about student's name and grades. Create a collection of Students with a few Student objects. Sort it by average grade in descending order and display collection on the screen. Display ID, full name, average grade and a list of all grades. Sorting should be based on anonymous methods using lambda expressions.
