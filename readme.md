# 1. Student

### Using lambda functions to sort collection

Create class Student, which contains information about student's name and grades. Create a collection of Students with a few Student objects. Sort it by average grade in descending order and display collection on the screen. Display ID, full name, average grade and a list of all grades. Sorting should be based on anonymous methods using lambda expressions.

# 2. LINQ

### Using LINQ to Objects

Create a "database" (some object, i.e. a book or a contact) and store it in a collection. Add serialization to it.

Create a menu of operations with "database" using LINQ (search, ordering, etc.).
